# VLBA Cloud DevOps Techniques

## Introduction and Mission

- Understand *cloud native computing*
  - cp. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_native_computing
- Understand and use selected related technologies, architectures, and workflows
  - for an overview on related technologies cp. https://landscape.cncf.io/
- Understand and know to use techniques like a participant in a distributed international project
  - overall organization: project repo managed according to the **feature branch pattern**
    - weekly feature branch
    - forbidden to change master branch
    - **mandatory** pull request **after** successful test
    - automatic merge, new feature branch thereafter
  - consider homeworks as sprints
  - lecture and consultation/exercise encompass SCRUM meeting

## Organization

### Privacy

Do not record the lecture.

### Credit Points and Examination

- Lecture, 6 CP, English, part of (German and English) master programs
- Lecture/Consultation on Thursday/Tuesday

- Review organization/examination: multiple homeworks (no written exam)
  > ("Pr√ºfungsform: mehrere Hausarbeiten")

### Personnel Repository (repo) and Login

- Git Server URL
- https://magitea.cloudlv.site
- User name and password
  - The official OvGU student e-mail address is used for user name generation. The respective user name is everything *before* '@st.ovgu.de'.
    - '\<user name\>@st.ovgu.de'
  - The initial password **must be changed** after first login.
    - It is 'Cloud19.'

### Consultation's Organization

First of all: questions towards the exercises are OK! **But** we will only
discuss *informed* and *well-prepared* questions concerning a specific task
within an exercise. *Informed* and *well-prepared* means:

- First, post your problem as an issue (to the **lecture** repo)
- Describe the problem as detailed as possible, e.g.: "Its not working ..."
  will not be considered.  

  We expect something like this:
  > "this is my source code ..."  
  "there is a problem at line ..."  
  "according to \<documentation\>, p. \<page\> ..." (provide an URL or copy the respective text)  
  > "I expect ... to happen, but ..."

### General Communication

- Use *Markdown* to write down explanations, issues, etc. For Markdown's *basic* syntax see e.g. https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
