# Lesson: Python - basic Python

Remember from applying the "UNIX philosophy":

> - Mixing languages is better than writing everything in one, if and only if using only that one is likely to overcomplicate the program.
>
> - Whenever possible, prototype in an interpreted language before coding C.

- Python 3.7+
