# Lesson: Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)

- Continuous integration (CI), cp. "Practice of Cloud System Administration, The: DevOps and SRE Practices for Web Services, Volume 2" by Thomas A. Limoncelli, Strata R. Chalup, Christina J. Hogan, chapter 9.5

  > "Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of doing the build phase many times a day in an automated fashion. Each run of the build phase is triggered by some event, usually a code commit. All the build-phase steps then run in a fully automated fashion."

- Continuous delivery (CD), cp. "Practice of Cloud System Administration, The: DevOps and SRE Practices for Web Services, Volume 2" by Thomas A. Limoncelli, Strata R. Chalup, Christina J. Hogan, chapter 8.6.2

  > "Continuous delivery (CD) is a set of principles and practices for delivery of software and updates on an ongoing basis. Software delivery means the process by which software goes from source code to ready-to-use installation packages. Included in this process are the building (compiling) of the software packages as well as any quality testing."
